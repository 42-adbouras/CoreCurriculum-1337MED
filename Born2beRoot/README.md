Introduction
=======

The aim of Born2beRoot is to learn and explore the fundamentals of `system administration` by inviting us to install a `virtual machime` using VirtualBox.
We have to create a server respecting the partition scheme defined in the subject, and we have the right to choose between two Linux distributions (Debian or Rocky).
I personally went with Debian instead of Rocky.
- The diffrence between Debian & Rocky:
  Since I'm new to system administration, and project recommended to work with Debian, I was convinced to choose it.

|Debian | Rocky|
