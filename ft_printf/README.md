# Why ft_printf is important?
**Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough!**

Printf allows you to explore parsing and learn deeply about variadic functions in C.

# Mandatory
The goal of this project is to create a libftprintf.a library containing the recoded version the popular and versatile libc function printf(). 

You have to implement the following conversions: 

 - `%c` Prints a single character.  
 - `%s` Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
 - `%p` The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
 - `%d` Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
 - `%i` Prints an integer in base 10. 
 - `%u` Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number. 
 - `%x` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
 - `%X` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format. 
 - `%%` Prints a percent sign.
